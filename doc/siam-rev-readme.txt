Execute in MATLAB the following scripts:

- example_aut_sysid_siam.m

to reproduce the numerical results in sections 3.1-3

- example_sysid_siam.m

to reproduce the numerical results in sections 3.4

- example_ddsim_siam.m

to reproduce the numerical results in sections 3.5

- example_gcd_siam.m 

to reproduce the numerical results in sections 3.6

Note: If you are using Windows, change 'opt.solver = 'c'' to 'opt.solver = 'm''.
